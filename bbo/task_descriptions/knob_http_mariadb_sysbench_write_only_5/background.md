# Background

`knob_http_mariadb_sysbench_write_only_5` is a **real** MariaDB benchmark in *AgentBBO*. The optimizer proposes a point in the unit hypercube; the **HTTP evaluator** (Flask inside the image built from `bbo/tasks/database/docker/`) writes `mysqld` knobs, restarts MariaDB, and runs **sysbench**, returning a scalar **throughput** score.

This packaging combines: **write-only (OLTP write)** with **five knobs from the top-5 SHAP-ranked subset (`knobs_SYSBENCH_top5.json`).**

This benchmark uses the **sysbench** test ``oltp_write_only``.

The measurement is **not** a surrogate: it is the container’s live database and sysbench output. What is “simulated” is only the synthetic `sbtest` dataset and fixed script parameters in `server.py`.

A Chinese companion is in `background.zh.md` (informational only; loaders use the English files for canonical context).
